    <h2>The Retold Story</h2>
    <p>Peter was a teenage boy who often seemed a little lonely, though he never caused trouble.  
He had an older sister, Sarah, who was too mature to really play with him, though she sometimes tried.  
Their father worked hard as a farmer, and their mother took care of the home.  
It was a typical family for their time, where roles were well defined and not often questioned.</p>

<p>Peter wanted his father's approval more than anything, even though his father rarely showed affection.  
Sometimes, the two of them would go to the fields together, and Peter would help plant seeds.  
His father didn't say much, but those moments felt important to Peter.</p>

<p>One day, while they were working, Peter heard the sound of coins jingling in his father's pocket.  
<br/>"Would you like one, Peter?" his father asked.  
<br/>"Could I have just one, please?"  
<br/>His father handed him a coin. "Here you go."  
<br/>"Thank you, Father."</p>

<p>Though they went back to work, Peter’s thoughts were full of dreams.  
He imagined the coin could help his father buy a mower so he could come home sooner.  
Maybe it could even help buy a car so the whole family could spend more time together.  
But Peter was still a kid, and he ended up turning the coin into a game.  
Pretending to be a pirate, he buried the coin like treasure.</p>

<p>He closed his eyes. Dug a small hole. Buried the coin. Covered it with dirt. Took three steps back. Opened his eyes. Dug it up again.  
<br/>He closed his eyes. Dug a small hole. Buried the coin. Covered it with dirt. Took three steps back. Opened his eyes. Dug it up again.  
<br/>He closed his eyes. Dug a small hole. Buried the coin. Covered it with dirt. Took three steps back. Opened his eyes—  
<br/>But this time, it was gone.  
<br/>Panicking, Peter dug all around but couldn’t find it.  
He tried again and again, but the coin had disappeared.</p>

<p>Later, when his family realized he was missing, his mother found him hiding in his room.  
<br/>"What are you doing in here all day?"  
<br/>"I lost the coin," he said quietly.  
<br/>His sister and father came in.  
Peter wanted to explain, but his father’s calm, serious gaze made him feel scared and small.  
He said nothing.</p>

<p>The next day, his father brought him back to the field.  
<br/>"Where did you lose it?"  
<br/>"Somewhere around here."  
<br/>After a few minutes, his father reached down.  
<br/>"Here it is."  
<br/>"How did you find it?"  
<br/>"I work with this soil every day. I know how it moves. But why didn’t you just tell me? I wouldn’t have punished you."  
<br/>Peter looked at him, surprised. "You wouldn’t have?"  
<br/>His father said nothing more. They returned home.</p>

<p>In the quiet car ride back, Peter whispered under his breath:  
<br/>"I was just playing, pretending I was a pirate.  
I wanted to believe the coin could buy time with you.  
I was scared you’d think I was wasting it.  
But I wasn’t. I just wanted you to care."  
<br/>His father didn’t reply. But Peter saw him swipe a hand across his cheek.</p>

<p>His father never brought up the coin again.  
But from then on, he carried it in his shirt pocket, close to his heart—  
just as Peter carried it in his memory, close to his own.</p>
